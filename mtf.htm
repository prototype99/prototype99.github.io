	            <li>please note this is mostly from a UK perspective. if you can get access to NHS services please do, they theoretically should lead to better results, however understandably it may be taking too long unfortunately. always get <a href="http://www.harleystgenderclinic.com/">advice from a trained medical professional</a>, this is meant to serve only as a guide.</li>
              <li>{get a blood test specifically for estrogen, testosterone, potassium, sodium and other general levels. you should be able to get one under NHS if you explain that you want to reduce risk. if not, there are also private options[1]}</li>
              <li>{you need a testosterone blocker such as spironolactone and estradiol which is available in brands such as estrofem and progynova. estradiol may be bound in a salt such as estradiol valerate.[1]}{you may also want progesterone for the extra feminising properties, which will have to be taken rectally for best effect,[2]}{however you should not take it straight away.[3]}{merchants include: AllDayChemist.com, inhouse pharmacy.[1]} (and also <a href="https://gendergp.co.uk/self-medicating/">here</a>?)</li>
              <li>{it is advisable to start with 100mg spironolactone and 2mg estradiol to initially judge any effects on the body for 3 weeks. if you experience any bad side effects at any point please seek advice. feeling any symptoms of sleepiness and {soreness (or the lack of) in developing breasts is natural although you may find breast massages help with growth as will <a href="sleep.htm">getting enough sleep</a>.[2]} also make sure to get the fact you are self medicating put on your medical record. do not smoke.[1]}</li>
              <li>{after 3 weeks if required you may move onto up to 200mg spironolactone and 4mg estradiol[1]}</li>
              <li>{you may find you need even more in which case you may move onto up to 300mg spironolactone and 6mg estradiol. higher doses may be required however please be cautious and do it one increment at a time. your main goal is to hit normal female ranges.[1]}{for testosterone this is 0.3-1.3ng/mL[2]}</li>
              <li>{remember to get a blood test 6 months after your last one![1]}</li>
              <li>{at 8/9 months of estradiol you may consider introducing progesterone in some form[3]}</li>
              <li>{make sure to regularly get blood tests every 6 months in order to check everything is staying stable[1]}</li>
