	<main>
  there is no linux port of warframe. there are two solutions to this problem: running it under steam's new proton/steamplay (with some unofficial patches/workarounds) or running it in a virtual machine. both can achieve stable gameplay, however in this guide we'll detail the more native steam option. please inform me if the instructions become outdated.
	        <ol>
              <li>install the game in steam</li>
	            <li>head over to https://gitlab.com/GloriousEggroll/warframe-linux/tree/steamplay-proton and download the latest version.</li>
	            <li>extract it and place all the files in your warframe installation, in the closest equivalent to /home/[user]/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Warframe/Tools/ where [user] is your username</li>
	            <li>ensure a steam recognised controller is plugged in.</li>
	            <li>add the --firstrun launch option, but remove it after warframe opens up. you should now be set</li>
